# SQOIN-API Specification

## 1. Overview

**SQOIN-API** is a communication layer that sits between:

- **Consumer** (client or application)  
- **Server** (the actual API backend)

SQOIN-API uses an LLM (Large Language Model) in two primary ways:

1. **Translation**: Ensures that requests/responses conform to each side’s schema, despite potential differences in naming, structure, or required fields.  
2. **Offline Fallback**: Predicts (simulates) server responses if the server is unavailable, using previously observed request–response pairs and an LLM for inference.

### Key Goals

- **Schema Compatibility**: Bridge schema differences without manually rewriting code every time the server or consumer changes.  
- **Downtime Resilience**: Provide approximate or “best-guess” responses from the LLM when the server cannot be reached.  
- **Cost Optimization** (optional): Optionally reduce recurring LLM calls by generating bridging code once per version change, then caching or statically compiling that code into the consumer.

### 2.1 Normal Operation (Server Online)

1. **Consumer → SQOIN-API**  
   - Consumer sends a request in its *native* format.  
2. **SQOIN-API → LLM** (translation step)  
   - If necessary, SQOIN-API calls the LLM to transform the consumer’s request into the server’s format.  
   - *(Alternatively, if the bridging code has been pre-generated, no live LLM call is needed; a local function or library handles it.)*  
3. **SQOIN-API → Server**  
   - The transformed request is forwarded to the server.  
4. **Server → SQOIN-API**  
   - The server returns a real response.  
5. **SQOIN-API → LLM** (response translation step)  
   - Again, if needed, the LLM (or pre-generated code) transforms the server’s response into the consumer’s expected schema.  
6. **SQOIN-API → Consumer**  
   - The translated response is sent back.  
7. **Logging**  
   - Each request–response pair is stored in a knowledge base or database for offline fallback learning.

### 2.2 Offline Mode (Server Unavailable)

1. **Consumer → SQOIN-API**  
   - Consumer sends a request, but the server is offline or unreachable.  
2. **SQOIN-API**  
   - SQOIN-API detects server downtime, so it attempts to **predict** the server’s response using stored data + an LLM.  
   1. **Retrieves** similar request–response pairs from its knowledge base.  
   2. **Prompts** the LLM with those examples to generate a predicted response.  
3. **SQOIN-API → Consumer**  
   - Returns the predicted (simulated) response to the consumer, optionally flagged as “offline approximate.”  
4. **(Post-Recovery)**  
   - When the server comes back online, SQOIN-API can replay any offline requests to get the real response and compare or reconcile if needed.

### 2.3 Dummy Implementation (No Real Server at All)

In some early stages of a project—or when the server side is not implemented yet—SQOIN-API can operate in a **dummy implementation mode**. This mode is similar to offline fallback but differs in that the system **never attempts to call a real server**, because none exists.

1. **Consumer → SQOIN-API**  
   - The Consumer sends a request in its *native* format.  
2. **SQOIN-API**  
   - SQOIN-API is configured in a “dummy” mode indicating no real server is available (not even a down server).  
   - Based on the request and its parameters, SQOIN-API uses either:
     - **Simple heuristics** or placeholders for the response, or  
     - **An LLM** to generate a plausible response that matches the consumer’s expected schema.
3. **SQOIN-API → Consumer**  
   - Returns the synthetic response to the consumer, often marked with a flag or annotation (e.g., `"dummyMode": true`).  
4. **Purpose**  
   - This mode helps teams build or test the client side before the backend is ready.  
   - You can later switch to a real or “online” mode once the backend is implemented.

## 3. Endpoints & Data Flows

Below is a suggested set of **HTTP endpoints** for SQOIN-API. These can be adapted to gRPC or other protocols if desired.

### 3.1 `/translate` (Main Proxy Endpoint)

**Purpose**: Handles incoming consumer requests, transforms them to the server schema, calls the server if available (or predicts if offline), then returns a translated response.

- **Method**: `POST`  
- **Request Body**:  
  ```json
  {
    "context": {
      "apiKey": "string (optional)",
      "timestamp": "ISO8601",
      "metadata": {
        "...": "any additional info"
      }
    },
    "payload": {
      // The consumer's data
      // Format: arbitrary JSON
    }
  }
  ```  
- **Response Body**:  
  ```json
  {
    "context": {
      "processedBy": "SQOIN-API vX.Y",
      "offlineMode": "boolean (true if server was offline)",
      "timestamp": "ISO8601"
    },
    "payload": {
      // The final response to the consumer
      // Typically in the consumer's expected schema
    }
  }
  ```

#### Behavior

1. **Check Server Status**  
   - If **online**, pass `payload` to LLM-based translator (if needed), then call the real server.  
   - If **offline** or **in dummy mode**, skip calling the server and generate a predicted or synthetic response.

2. **LLM-based Transformation**  
   - If code bridging is not pre-generated, the system may call the LLM with a prompt that includes:  
     - **Consumer schema** (or a pointer to it).  
     - **Server schema** (or a pointer).  
     - **Consumer request**.  
   - The LLM returns a valid server request format (except in dummy mode, where it might skip the translation if no server schema is available).  
   - Upon receiving the server’s (or predicted/synthetic) response, the LLM transforms it back into the consumer’s expected schema.

3. **Logging**  
   - Store the (consumer → server) request and (server → consumer) response in the knowledge base, including dummy-mode or offline-mode indicators.

### 3.2 `/server-status`

**Purpose**: Indicates whether the server is online or offline from SQOIN-API’s perspective.

- **Method**: `GET`  
- **Response** (example):  
  ```json
  {
    "status": "online", // or "offline" / "degraded" / "dummy"
    "lastCheck": "ISO8601"
  }
  ```
- **Implementation Detail**: Typically, SQOIN-API might do a health-check ping to the server at intervals and keep a cached status.  
- **Dummy Mode**: In a dummy implementation scenario, `status` may be forced to something like `"dummy"` or `"none"` to indicate there is no real backend.

### 3.3 `/logs`

**Purpose**: Allows retrieval of stored request–response pairs for debugging or training/fine-tuning.

- **Method**: `GET` or `POST`  
- **Parameters**: paging, filtering by date or request type, etc.  
- **Response** (example):  
  ```json
  {
    "entries": [
      {
        "requestId": "abc123",
        "consumerPayload": {...},
        "serverPayload": {...},
        "serverResponse": {...},
        "createdAt": "ISO8601"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "pagination": {...}
  }
  ```
- **Security**: Potentially requires admin credentials because it may contain sensitive data.

### 3.4 (Optional) `/generate-bridge`

**Purpose**: Triggers a code generation step (if you opt for “compile-time” bridging logic).

- **Method**: `POST`  
- **Request Body**:  
  ```json
  {
    "consumerSpec": "<OpenAPI snippet or JSON schema>",
    "serverSpec": "<OpenAPI snippet or JSON schema>"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:  
  ```json
  {
    "bridgeCode": "string (the generated code / SDK / translator logic)"
  }
  ```
- **Usage**: The developer calls this endpoint to produce bridging code, then compiles or integrates it into the consumer. Not typically used by the consumer at runtime.

## 4. Data Models

Below are some suggested data structures used internally by SQOIN-API. You can adjust them to match your actual data or frameworks.

### 4.1 Knowledge Base Entry

```json
{
  "requestId": "string",
  "consumerRequest": {
    // raw or partially sanitized
  },
  "serverRequest": {
    // what was actually sent to the server
  },
  "serverResponse": {
    // what the server returned or what was generated in offline/dummy mode
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "version": "string (server version or translator version)",
  "status": "success | error"
}
```

### 4.2 LLM Prompt Template (High-Level)

```
System / Developer Prompt:
"You are the SQOIN-API translator.
The consumer format is described below:
<consumer spec>
The server format is described below:
<server spec>
Task: Convert the consumer request into the server request,
then if a server response is given, convert it back.
If in dummy mode, generate a synthetic response
based on the request parameters alone."
```

(Adjust as needed for offline fallback or dummy mode predictions.)

## 5. Offline Fallback Mechanism

### 5.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation

1. **Identify similarity**  
   - When the server is offline, SQOIN-API generates an embedding of the current request.  
   - It queries a vector DB or other retrieval system to find similar historical requests.  
2. **Few-shot examples**  
   - The N best matches, along with their actual server responses, are provided to the LLM as few-shot examples.  
3. **LLM generation**  
   - The LLM produces a predicted server response based on the retrieved examples.  
4. **Caching**  
   - If the request is identical (or near identical) to a prior one, SQOIN-API can skip the LLM call and return the cached prior response.

### 5.2 Confidence & Policy

- **Confidence Threshold**: If no sufficiently similar request is found (distance > threshold), the LLM might respond with “Unknown.”  
- **Consumer Notification**: The returned payload can include a flag like `"offlineMode": true`.

---

## 6. Lifecycle & Versioning

1. **Schema Changes**  
   - If the server updates its schema, you can update the reference in SQOIN-API.  
   - If using compile-time bridging code, call `/generate-bridge` with the new specs, test, then redeploy.  
2. **Model Updates**  
   - The LLM might be updated or fine-tuned on your logs to improve translation or offline predictions (and dummy responses).  
3. **Log Retention**  
   - Decide how long to keep request–response pairs. Some data might be sensitive, so observe regulatory or privacy constraints.

---

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Authentication**  
  - The consumer might attach an API key or OAuth token in the `context` object or an HTTP header.  
  - SQOIN-API may also need credentials to call the server.  
- **Encryption**  
  - Use TLS for all traffic to avoid leaking data.  
- **Data Minimization**  
  - If the server or consumer data is sensitive, store only what is necessary for offline fallback or dummy usage. Consider anonymizing or hashing PII (personally identifiable information).  
- **LLM Privacy**  
  - If you’re using a third-party LLM API (e.g., OpenAI), be aware of the content policies. Do not send unencrypted or highly sensitive data unless you trust the channel.

## 8. Example Interaction

### 8.1 Normal Mode

1. **Consumer** calls:
   ```http
   POST /translate
   {
     "context": {
       "apiKey": "abc-123",
       "timestamp": "2024-12-26T10:30:00Z"
     },
     "payload": {
       "firstName": "Alice",
       "lastName": "Smith"
     }
   }
   ```
2. **SQOIN-API** sees the server is online:  
   - Translates `{"firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Smith"}` → `{"f_name": "Alice", "l_name": "Smith"}`.  
   - Calls `POST /server/users` with the transformed request.
3. **Server** responds:
   ```json
   {
     "full_name": "Alice Smith",
     "user_id": "xyz123"
   }
   ```
4. **SQOIN-API** translates back to consumer format:
   ```json
   {
     "fullName": "Alice Smith",
     "id": "xyz123"
   }
   ```
5. **SQOIN-API** returns to consumer:
   ```http
   200 OK
   {
     "context": {
       "processedBy": "SQOIN-API v1.0",
       "offlineMode": false,
       "timestamp": "2024-12-26T10:30:01Z"
     },
     "payload": {
       "fullName": "Alice Smith",
       "id": "xyz123"
     }
   }
   ```
6. **SQOIN-API** logs the interaction in its knowledge base.

### 8.2 Offline Mode

1. **Consumer** calls the same `/translate` endpoint, but the server is down.  
2. **SQOIN-API** sees the server is offline:  
   - Looks up similar past requests in its logs.  
   - Finds a close match from the example above.  
   - Uses that prior server response + LLM to generate a predicted response.
3. **SQOIN-API** returns:
   ```http
   200 OK
   {
     "context": {
       "processedBy": "SQOIN-API v1.0",
       "offlineMode": true,
       "timestamp": "2024-12-26T10:31:00Z"
     },
     "payload": {
       "fullName": "Alice Smith",
       "id": "xyz123"
     }
   }
   ```
   *(This is an approximation of what the server *would* have returned.)*

### 8.3 Dummy Implementation Mode

1. **Consumer** calls `/translate` when the server is not just offline, but **non-existent** (e.g., not yet implemented).  
2. **SQOIN-API** is explicitly set to “dummy mode.”  
   - It either calls an LLM or uses a predefined set of response templates to construct a synthetic response.  
   - For example, based on the presence of `firstName` and `lastName`, it might create `"fullName": "<firstName> <lastName>"` and a dummy `"id"`.
3. **SQOIN-API** returns:
   ```http
   200 OK
   {
     "context": {
       "processedBy": "SQOIN-API v1.0",
       "dummyMode": true,
       "timestamp": "2024-12-26T10:31:00Z"
     },
     "payload": {
       "fullName": "Alice Smith",
       "id": "dummy-1234"
     }
   }
   ```
   *(This clarifies to the consumer that the response is fully synthetic.)*

## 9. Implementation Notes

1. **LLM Integration**  
   - You can use any model (OpenAI GPT-4, local LLM, etc.) with function calling or well-structured prompts.  
   - For critical use cases, always validate the LLM output with JSON schema validators.
2. **Caching & Code Generation** (Optional)  
   - For stable field mappings, generate static bridging code once (via an endpoint like `/generate-bridge`).  
   - Deploy that code so the translator rarely needs live LLM calls.
3. **Performance**  
   - If offline fallback or dummy usage is rare, LLM calls might be minimal.  
   - For high traffic, consider a robust caching or precomputation approach.
4. **Scalability**  
   - SQOIN-API can scale horizontally behind a load balancer.  
   - Maintain a shared knowledge base (database + vector index) accessible by all instances.

## Conclusion

**SQOIN-API** provides a robust, flexible layer between a consumer and a server by:

1. **Translating** between disparate schemas (using LLM translation or generated bridging code).  
2. **Logging** real request–response pairs for future reference.  
3. **Predicting** or **dummy-generating** server responses when the server is offline or not yet implemented.  

By following these guidelines, SQOIN-API ensures **smooth compatibility**, **downtime resilience**, and **flexibility** to evolve both the consumer and server schemas over time.  

For projects still under development, the **dummy implementation** mode accelerates front-end and client-side progress even before the actual backend API is live.
